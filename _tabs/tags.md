Hello everyone, this website is dedicated to posting my offensive security writeups; Although they're mainly TryHackMe and HackTheBox walkthroughs. I aim to help people learn these areas and offer a helping hand when stuck on challenges. I am a cybersecurity researcher with a strong interest in ethical hacking and security penetration testing and am currently studying for the eJPT certification. My distant goal/dream is to obtain the OSCP and start work as an ethical hacker while discovering all fields of cybersecurity. Thanks for reading and enjoy the posts!
